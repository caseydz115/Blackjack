## Blackjack for Ruby

### Description

Blackjack for Ruby is a single player game reminiscent of casino blackjack. The objective is to have a higher card sum than the dealer, but less than or equal to a sum of 21. A single player plays against the house, which is the dealer. The player may opt to 'hit,' or obtain a new card, or 'stay,' or maintain his or her current hand of cards. If the sum of the dealer's or player's hand busts (i.e., equals a sum greater than 21) and the opponent has not yet busted, the opponent wins. The player with the highest sum of cards, but less than or equal to 21, wins.
